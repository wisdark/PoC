Please note that Agile Information Security Limited (Agile InfoSec) relies on information provided by the vendor / product manufacturer when listing fixed versions, products or releases. Agile InfoSec does not verify this information, except when specifically mentioned in the advisory text and requested or contracted by the vendor to do so.   

Unconfirmed vendor fixes might be ineffective, incomplete or easy to bypass and it is the vendor's responsibility to ensure all the vulnerabilities found by Agile InfoSec are resolved properly. Agile InfoSec usually provides the information in its advisories free of charge to the vendor, as well as a minimum of six months for the vendor to resolve the vulnerabilities identified in its advisories before they are made public.

Agile InfoSec does not accept any responsibility, financial or otherwise, from any material losses, loss of life or reputational loss as a result of misuse of the information or code contained or mentioned in its advisories. It is the vendor's responsibility to ensure their products' security before, during and after release to market.
